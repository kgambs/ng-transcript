    <p> NG:"I was never the sort of person who wanted kids. I was never a, oh you know, when I get older I wanna have X amount of children.' And so I never really thought much about it, my fertility or anything of that nature. When I was just turning 30, so I was still 29, I was going to the gynaecologist because I was having some period issues and after all the tests and whatever, she essentially said that I already past my expiry date in terms of having kids. She said, 'You know, with your body, the way you are, I would have already stopped having kids by now.' It was so jolting. I just remember thinking, you've couldn't have been less thoughtful in how you delivered that news to me. And that was a real shock. It hit me like a tonne of bricks and made me feel like, oh, and yeah, I walked out of that appointment and cried. And I called my mum crying saying 'I don't know if I can have kids. Apparently I think I want them because I'm really upset!' \[laughs\]. My partner at the time basically stopped having feelings for me with this news. So there was this huge stigma around 'Oh you can't give me children, well I guess this is a waste of my time'. That was hard. And fast forward, I'm, what am I, 39 this year, um, and for the last, I'm gonna say, 4 years, I've been in my actively trying to fall pregnant mode with my current partner, husband. And we decided to get fertility tested. And on paper there's nothing really wrong between the two of us. There's nothing that says clearly, 'well this is why you can't fall pregnant and this is why you can'y get her pregnant'; we just aren't falling pregnant. And it's... like, what do you do? What do you say to that? Where do you go from there? So we started a journey of tracked ovulation and all these really unromantic processes that you don't really get guidance on. You just have to do it. And it's not inspiring, it takes the romance out of your life. And I just feel like, now, it's at a crunch. Like I said I'm almost 40 and I'm like, I don't... do I even want this anymore? It's too hard, it's all too hard \[laughs\]. IVF feels too hard. I don't want to do IVF, why should I have to do IVF? Just cos my body won't do, whatever it is it's not doing to get pregnant - I don't even know! I don't even know what it is! What's wrong with my body? I don't know! It just feels like the journey that will never end unless I try IVF. And even if I do try IVF, what if it doesn't work? Then what?"
